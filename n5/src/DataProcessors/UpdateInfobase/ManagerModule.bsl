// Intermediate release means that the following updates must be generated based on the last intermediate release.
// Explanation. Let’s say we have these changes in our application:
// Release 1.0.0.1. We create Catalog1 with Delivery string field.
// Release 1.0.1.1. We decide to change type of Delivery field from string to number.
// 					Thus, we rename Delivery to DeliveryRemove and create a new field Delivery as number type.
//					We also have to provide an update procedure in order to convert data
//					from DeliveryRemove to Delivery.
// Release 1.0.2.1. We remove DeliveryRemove field from the Catalog1.
//
// A couple of concerns here.
// An update 1.0.2.1 has to be formed on 1.0.1.1, otherwise user’s data will be lost.
// The direct update from 1.0.0.1 to 1.0.2.1 will instantly delete Delivery string field and create
// new Delivery number field. Therefore, updating procedures will give errors because of missing
// DeliveryRemove field from update 1.0.1.1.
//
// In order to make everything right, we should:
// Produce 1.0.2.1 release based on 1.0.1.1
// Declare 1.0.1.1 release as an intermediate: list.Add ( entry ( "1.0.1.1", true ) );
//
// Besides, take into account that before last Intermediate Update all entries exist for history only.
// Which means that actual update procedures are not required. Updates for such releases will never be executed.
//
